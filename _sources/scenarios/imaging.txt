Python Imaging Library
----------------------

The `Python Imaging Library <http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/>`_, or PIL
for short, is *the* library for image manipulation in Python.

It works with Python 1.5.2 and above, including 2.5, 2.6 and 2.7. Unfortunately,
it doesn't work with 3.0+ yet.
